By Wyatt Wirt

This Tutorial with help with understanding the difference between types of intellectual property ideas (EX: Trademark, Copyright, etc.) The tutorial will give the user a situation where someone has invented something and they need to know what kind of protection to get for their new idea. The user will read through the text, be give clues throughout, and then attempt to decide which kind of protection they will need to keep the idea for their own.

The target audience for this tutorial is beginning IT students or even those just deciding to get into IT to better understand the differences between these types of protections. Especially with the younger generation being more into sharing their lives with a platform such as YouTube they need to understand what kinds of intellectual protections are in place for them, and for others.

## Trade Marks

Let's Begin with Trade Marks, A trademark, trade mark, or trade-mark is a recognizable sign, design, or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others, although trademarks used to identify services are usually called service marks. These can include marks such as, MacDonald Golden Arches, along with the words "I'm Lovin It" below, The nike logo with "Just Do It" below.

For More Information on these there is the US Patent and Trademark Office Website and a video that they produced below that!

## Patents

Now we are going to move onto Patents, A patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time, usually twenty years. The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention.

## CopyRight

Next we have, Copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of "original works of authorship" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished. The 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work, to perform the copyrighted work publicly, or to display the copyrighted work publicly.

The copyright protects the form of expression rather than the subject matter of the writing. For example, a description of a machine could be copyrighted, but this would only prevent others from copying the description; it would not prevent others from writing a description of their own or from making and using the machine. Copyrights are registered by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.

## Trade Secret

Finally we have, Trade secrets consist of information and can include a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process. To meet the most common definition of a trade secret, it must be used in business, and give an opportunity to obtain an economic advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.

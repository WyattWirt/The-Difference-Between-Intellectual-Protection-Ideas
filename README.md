Let's Begin with Trade Marks, A trademark, trade mark, or trade-mark is a recognizable sign, design, or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others, although trademarks used to identify services are usually called service marks. These can include marks such as, MacDonoalds Golden Arches, along with the words "I'm Lovin It" below, The nike logo with "Just Do It" below.

For More Information on these there is the US Patent and Trademark Office Website and a video that they produced below that!
